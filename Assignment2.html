	Don't stay awake for too long<br>
	Don't go to bed
	I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
	It'll get you up and going out of bed

	<div class="col"><p>Yeah...</p></div>
	I don't wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away<br>
	I been thinking of our future cause I'll never see those days
	I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
	I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect
	I been praying for forgiveness, you been praying for my health
	When I leave this earth, hoping you'll find someone else
	Cause yeah, we still young there's so much we haven't done
	Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son
	I wish it could be me, but I won't make it off this bed
	I hope I go to heaven, so I see you once again
	My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
	Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending
	<div class="col"><p>Don't stay awake for too long</p></div>
	Don't go to bed<br>
	I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
	It'll get you up and going out of bed
